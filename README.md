# Digital Ghosts — Interactive Kiosk Frontend

This repository contains the frontend for an interactive kiosk created for the Digital Ghosts exhibition at Inspace, University of Edinburgh. The exhibition invites visitors to engage creatively with web archives.</br>

Project site: https://inspace.ed.ac.uk/digital-ghosts/

Purpose</br>
This webapp lets users submit URLs to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine and records those submissions to a Google Form and a csv for display in the exhibition. It's optimised for kiosk screen and on-site visitor interaction.</br>
